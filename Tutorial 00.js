  To get started with JS you will need a text editor and compiler.

  Text editors are common, I would personally recomend Atom (http://atom.io).
  Compilers can be browser based or software based, Node.js is the best one (https://nodejs.org/en/).

  To compile JS in Node.js, just type "node main.js" in CMD, where main.js is the filename.
  In HTML you can include JavaScript with "<script src="main.js"></script>" in the <head> tag.
  If you want to use JS as a scripting language I would recomend you know how to write some HTML.

  You don't technically need a text editor, but you should have one.
  Just download and install Atom (it is free!) and you should be ready to roll.

  To start your first project, just create a folder named "Learning" or whatever you want.
  Then, right-click and open in Atom, create a file named main.js (and index.html if you want to use HTML too).

  To start, compile this file by typing "node jsTutorial/Tutorial 00.js" in CMD

console.log("Test");
