/*
  Issued challenge:
    Use JavaScript to compare the values of 3 and 5.
    Display if they are equil by using an if else statement

  Example:

    if(3 == 5){
      console.log("They are equil");
    }
    else if(3 < 5){
      console.log("Five is greater than 3");
    }

  Notice:
    if else statements can be stacked, so you can have
    if(){

    }
    else if(){

    }
    else if(){

    }
    else{

  }
